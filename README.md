# Task Management Application

I have developed a Task Management Application using React, Node, and MongoDB. The code has been deployed on Render for the frontend and backend and Firebase for the database.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend locally, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run start` to start the development server.

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `nodemon server.js` to start the backend server.

## Code Documentation

All code is properly documented to provide clear understanding and maintainability.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Render. You can access the deployed application at https://pesto-fullstack-task.onrender.com/.

## GitHub Repository

The source code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/YogeshAbnave/pesto-task.git](https://github.com/YogeshAbnave/pesto-task.git).

## Folder Structure

In the `development` branch, you will find two folders: `pesto-task-frontend` and `pesto-task-backend`, containing all the code. The `backend` branch specifically includes the backend code deployed on Render.

## Pending Work
Some pending tasks include design enhancements and optional features. I will work on these tasks as soon as I have free time.

I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. Thank you for your interest in the Task Management Application!


## Feedback

I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have. Feel free to explore the application, and if you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvement, please let me know.
